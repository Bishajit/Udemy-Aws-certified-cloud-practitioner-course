Sect 12 Lev3eraging the AWS Gloal infrastructure 

part 139
Global AWS Infrastructure • Regions: For deploying
applications and
infrastructure
• Availability Zones: Made
of multiple data centers
• Edge Locations (Points
of Presence): for
content delivery as
close as possible to
users

Global Applications in AWS
• Global DNS: Route 53
	• Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
	• Great for disaster recovery strategies
• Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
	• Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations – decrease latency
	• Cache common requests – improved user experience and decreased latency
• S3 Transfer Acceleration
	• Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
• AWS Global Accelerator:
	• Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network

part 140
Amazon Route 53 Overview
• Route53 is a (Managed DNS) (Domain Name System)
• DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand
how to reach a server through URLs.
• In AWS, the most common records are:
• www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
• www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
• search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
• example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc…)

Route 53 Routing Policies
-SIMPLE ROUTING POLICY
-WEIGHTED ROUTING POLICY
-LATENCY ROUTING POLICY
-FAILOVER ROUTING POLICY

part 142

AWS CloudFront
• Content Delivery Network (CDN)
• Improves read performance, content
is cached at the edge
• Improves users experience
• 216 Point of Presence globally (edge
locations)
• DDoS protection (because
worldwide), integration with Shield,
AWS Web Application Firewall

CloudFront
– Origins 
• S3 bucket 
	• For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
	• Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
	• CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
	• Custom Origin (HTTP) 
Custom Origin(HTTP)
	• Application Load Balancer 
	• EC2 instance 
	• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website) 
	• Any HTTP backend you want

CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
• CloudFront:
	• Global Edge network
	• Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
	• Great for static content that must be available everywhere
• S3 Cross Region Replication:
	• Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
	• Files are updated in near real-time
	• Read only
	• Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

Part 144
S3 Transfer Acceleration
• Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location
which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region

AWS Global Accelerator
• Improve global application availability
and performance using the AWS
global network
• Leverage the AWS internal network
to optimize the route to your
application (60% improvement)
• 2 Anycast IP are created for your
application and traffic is sent through
Edge Locations
• The Edge locations send the traffic to
your application

part 145

AWS Global Accelerator
• Improve global application availability
and performance using the AWS
global network
• Leverage the AWS internal network
to optimize the route to your
application (60% improvement)
• 2 Anycast IP are created for your
application and traffic is sent through
Edge Locations
• The Edge locations send the traffic to
your application

AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
• CloudFront – Content Delivery Network
	• Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
	• Content is served at the edge
• Global Accelerator
	• No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
	• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

AWS Outposts • Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on
- premises infrastructure alongside a cloud
infrastructure
• Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems: • One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console,
CLI, and AWS APIs)
• One for their on
-premises infrastructure
• AWS Outposts are “server racks” that offers the
same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools
to build your own applications on
-premises just as in the cloud
• AWS will setup and manage “Outposts Racks”
within your on
-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
• You are responsible for the Outposts Rack
physical security

AWS Outposts
• Benefits:
• Low-latency access to on-premises systems
• Local data processing
• Data residency
• Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
• Fully managed service

part 147
AWS WaveLength
• WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers’
datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
• Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
• Example: EC2, EBS, VPC…
• Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
• Traffic doesn’t leave the Communication Service
Provider’s (CSP) network
• High-bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS Region
• No additional charges or service agreements
• Use cases: Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/VR,
Real-time Gaming, …
