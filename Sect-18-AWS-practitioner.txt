Section 18 Account Management, Billing and Support


Part 206

AWS Organizations
• Global service
• Allows to manage (multiple AWS accounts)
• The main account is the master account
• Cost Benefits:
	• (Consolidated Billing) across all accounts - single payment method
	• Pricing benefits from (aggregated usage) (volume discount for EC2, S3…)
	• (Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances) for optimal savings
• API is available to (automate AWS account creation)
• (Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies) (SCP)

• API is available to automate AWS account creation
• Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP)

Multi Account Strategies
• Create accounts per (department), per (cost center), per (dev) / (test) /
(prod), based on (regulatory restrictions) (using SCP), for (better
resource isolation) (ex: VPC), to have (separate per-account service
limits), isolated account for (logging)
• Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
• Use tagging standards for billing purposes
• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
• Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

• Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
• Use tagging standards for billing purposes
• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account

Service Control Policies (SCP)
• Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
• Applied at the (OU) or (Account) level
• Does not apply to the Master Account
• SCP is applied to all the (Users and Roles) of the Account, including Root user
• The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
	• Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and can't be restricted by SCPs.
• SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
• Use cases:
	• Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)
	• Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

part 208

AWS Control Tower
• Easy way to set up and govern a secure and compliant (multi-account
AWS environment) based on best practices
• Benefits:
	• Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
	• Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
	• Detect policy violations and remediate them
	• Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard
• AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organizations:
	• It automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)

part 210

Pricing Models in AWS

	• Automatically applied to the resource you create
	• Starts with Prefix aws: (e.g. aws: createdBy)
• (User-defined tags)
	• Defined by the user
	• Starts with Prefix (user:) 

Tagging and Resource Groups
• (Tags) are used for organizing resources:
	• EC2: instances, images, load balancers, security groups…
	• RDS, VPC resources, Route 53, IAM users, etc…
	• Resources created by CloudFormation are all tagged the same way
• Free naming, common tags are: Name, Environment, Team …
• Tags can be used to create (Resource Groups)
	• Create, maintain, and view a collection of resources that share common tags
	• Manage these tags using the Tag Editor

Cost and Usage Reports
• Dive deeper into your AWS costs and usage
• The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains (the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available), including additional metadata
about AWS services, pricing, and reservations (e.g., Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs)).
• The AWS Cost & Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service
category used by an account and its IAM users in hourly or daily line
items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation
purposes.
• Can be integrated with Athena, Redshift or QuickSight

Simple Monthly Calculator / Pricing Calculator
