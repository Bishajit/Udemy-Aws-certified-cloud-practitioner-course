Section 18 Account Management, Billing and Support


Part 206

AWS Organizations
• Global service
• Allows to manage (multiple AWS accounts)
• The main account is the master account
• Cost Benefits:
	• (Consolidated Billing) across all accounts - single payment method
	• Pricing benefits from (aggregated usage) (volume discount for EC2, S3…)
	• (Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances) for optimal savings
• API is available to (automate AWS account creation)
• (Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies) (SCP)

• API is available to automate AWS account creation
• Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP)

Multi Account Strategies
• Create accounts per (department), per (cost center), per (dev) / (test) /
(prod), based on (regulatory restrictions) (using SCP), for (better
resource isolation) (ex: VPC), to have (separate per-account service
limits), isolated account for (logging)
• Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
• Use tagging standards for billing purposes
• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
• Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

Service Control Policies (SCP)
• Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
• Applied at the (OU) or (Account) level
• Does not apply to the Master Account
• SCP is applied to all the (Users and Roles) of the Account, including Root user
• The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
	• Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and can't be restricted by SCPs.
• SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
• Use cases:
	• Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)
	• Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

part 208

AWS Control Tower
• Easy way to set up and govern a secure and compliant (multi-account
AWS environment) based on best practices
• Benefits:
	• Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
	• Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
	• Detect policy violations and remediate them
	• Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard
• AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organizations:
	• It automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)

part 210

Pricing Models in AWS
• AWS has 4 pricing models:
• (Pay as you go): pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale
demands
• (Save when you reserve): minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply
with long-terms requirements
	• Reservations are available for EC2 Reserved Instances, DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, ElastiCache Reserved Nodes, RDS Reserved Instance, Redshift Reserved Nodes
• (Pay less by using more): volume-based discounts
• (Pay less as AWS grows)

Free services & free tier in AWS

Free
