IAM; USERS & GROUPS
-IAM = Identity and access management, global service 
-Root account created by default shouldn't be used or shared
-Users are people within your organization and can be grouped 
-groups only contain users, not other groups
-Users don't have to belong to multiple groups and users can belong to multiple groups

 
IAM; PERMISSIONS 
-USERS OR gROUPS CAN BE ASSIGNED JSON DOCUMENTS called policies 
-These policies define the permissions of the users
-In AWS you apply the least privvilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs
