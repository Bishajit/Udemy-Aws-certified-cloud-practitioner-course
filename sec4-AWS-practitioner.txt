Sec 4 part 14 Introduction:USers,groups,policies

IAM; USERS & GROUPS
-IAM = Identity and access management, global service 
-Root account created by default shouldn't be used or shared
-Users are people within your organization and can be grouped 
-groups only contain users, not other groups
-Users don't have to belong to multiple groups and users can belong to multiple groups

 
IAM; PERMISSIONS 
-USERS OR gROUPS CAN BE ASSIGNED JSON DOCUMENTS called policies 
-These policies define the permissions of the users
-In AWS you apply the least privvilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs

Sec 4 part 15  IAM USERS and Groups hands on

Sec 5 part 16 IAM Policies
-policies for specified groupos
-inline policies designed for a specific user

Sec 4 part 18: IAM MFA overview
  
IAM-password policy 
-Strong passwords= higher security for your account

Multifactor authentication- MFA 
	-Users have access to your account and can possibly change configuration or delete resources in your aws account
	-You want to protect you Root accountsd and IAM users
	-MFA= Passwords you know= security device you own
   	- Main benefit of MFA-if password is stolen or hacked the account is not comprimised 
-MFA devices options in AWS
	-Virtual MFA device
		-Google Authenticator(phone only)
		-Authy(multi-device)
			-For Authy:support for multiple token on asingle device 
	-Universal 2nd factor (U2F) security key 
		- Yubikey by Yubico(3rd party)
			-support for multiple root and IAM usersusing a single security key
	-Hardware Key Fob MFA device 
		-Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
	-Harware key Fob MFA deccive for AWS GovCloud(US)
		-provide by SurePassID (3rd party)
