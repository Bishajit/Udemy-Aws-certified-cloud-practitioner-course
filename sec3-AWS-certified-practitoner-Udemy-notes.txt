how websites work
-CLIENT 
-NETWORK
-SERVER
	Servers are the like network of your mail

What is a server composed of?

-Compute CPU
-Memory RAM
	- ram + cpu = brain
-Storage data
Database Store data in a structured way
Network: Routers, Switchm, DNS server

IT terminology
	- Networks: cables routers, and servers connected with eachother
	- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet.
	- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server/ client on your network.  
Problems with traditional It approach 
- Pay for the rent for the data center
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintainenance 
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time 
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters (earthquake, power shutdown, fire...)

Can we externalize this?

SECTION 3 PART 8

What is cloud computing?
- Cloud computing is the on- demand delivery of compute power database storage, applications, and other IT storage. 
-Through a cloud services platform with pay as you go pricing 
- You can provision as many resources as you need, almost instantly 
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly.
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services. 

-Amazon web services owns and maintains the network -connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via the a web applicartion.

The five characteristic of Cloud Computing
-On demand self service 
	-Users provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access
	-resources avalible over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms 
- Multi tendancy and resource pooling:
	- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and application with security and privacy
	- Multiple customers are service from the same physical resoruces
-Rapid elasticity and scalabilty
	- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed 
	-Quickly and easily based on demand
-Measured service 
	-usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used.

Six Advantages of CLoud computing
!)Trade capital expensen (Capex) for operational expense (OPEX)
	- Pay on demand don't own hardware 
	- Reduced TOtal Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Operational Expense(OPEX)
2)Benefit from massive economies of scale
	Prices are reduced as AWS is more effecient due to large scale
3) Stop guessing capacity
	-Scale based on actual measured usage
4)Increased speed and agiltity 
5)Stop spending money and maintaining data centers 
6)Go global in minutes: Leverage the AWS global infrastructurev 

SEC 3 part 9
Types of cloud computing 
-Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	-Amazon EC2
	-GCP,Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
-Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	-Elastic Beanstalk (On AWS)
	-Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP) Windows Azure(Microsoft)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
	-Many AwS services
	-Google apps, Dropbox, Zoom

Pricing of the cloud- Quick Overview
	-Compute
	-Storage
	-Data transfer Out of the Cloud
	-Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

Sec 3 part 10
AWS CLOud Use Cases
-Aws enables you to build, scalable applications
-Applicable to a diverse set of industries
-Use cases include
	-many tasks

Aws Global Infrastructure 
-AWS regions
-AWS Availibabality Zones
-AWS Data centers
-AWS EDGE locations/Points of presence

How to Chose an AWS region
	-Compliance
	- Proximity
	-Avalible services 
	-Pricing

Aws avalibility Zones
	-Each region has avg 3, min 2, max 6
	-Each avalibilty zone is one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
	-SSeperate from each other
	-connected with high bandwidth, ultra low latency networking

AWS points of presence 
	-216 points of presence

Tour of the AWS console 

Aws Has global services:
	-Identity and access managment (IAM)
	-Roughte 53 (DNS service)
	- Cloudfront (Content Delivery Network)

Sec 3 part 11 
	-Most services in AWS like EC@ is regional except for some like IAM
Sec 3 part 12 
	-UI changes
Sec 3 part 13
	- Customer = responsible for the security in the cloud
	-Aws - Responsible for the security of the cloud
