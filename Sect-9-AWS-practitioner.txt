Databases Intro
	• Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits
	• Sometimes, you want to store data in a database…
	• You can structure the data
	• You build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data
	• You define relationships between your datasets
	
	• Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints

Relational Databases
• Looks just like Excel spreadsheets, with links between them!
• Can use the SQL language to perform queries / lookups

NoSQL Databases
• NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases
• NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have
flexible schemas for building modern applications.
• Benefits:

	• Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
	• Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
	• High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
	• Highly functional: types optimized for the data model

• Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases

NoSQL data example: JSON

Databases & Shared Responsibility on AWS
	• AWS offers use to manage different databases
	• Benefits include:
	• Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
	• Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades
	• Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
	• Monitoring, alerting	
• Note: many databases technologies could be run on EC2, but you must
handle yourself the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault
tolerance, scaling… 

Part 96
AWS RDS Overview 
• RDS stands for Relational Database Service
• It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
• It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
	• Postgres
	• MySQL
	• MariaDB
	• Oracle
	• Microsoft SQL Server
	• Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
	• RDS is a managed service:
	• Automated provisioning, OS patching
	• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
	• Monitoring dashboards
	• Read replicas for improved read performance
	• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
	• Maintenance windows for upgrades
	• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
	• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
• BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

Amazon Aurora

• Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
• PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB
• Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement
over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
• Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
• Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient
• Not in the free tier

Part 98 RDS Deployments options

RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ
• Read Replicas: (hIGH SCALABILITY)
	• Scale the read workload of your DB
	• Can create up to 5 Read Replicas
	• Data is only written to the main DB
• Multi-AZ:
	• Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
	• Data is only read/written to the main database
	• Can only have 1 other AZ as failover

RDS Deployments: Multi-Region
	• Multi-Region (Read Replicas)
		• Disaster recovery in case of region issue
		• Local performance for global reads
		• Replication cost

Part 99 ElasticeCashe Overview

Amazon ElastiCache Overview
• The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases…
• ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
• Caches are (in-memory databases) with high performance, low latency
• Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads

• AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup,
configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

Part 100 DynamoDB

DynamoDB
• Fully Managed Highly available with replication across 3 AZ
• (NoSQL database - not a relational database)
• Scales to massive workloads, distributed “serverless” database
• Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
• Fast and consistent in performance
• (Single-digit millisecond latency) – (low latency retrieval)
• Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
• Low cost and auto scaling capabilities

DynamoDB – type of data
• DynamoDB is a key/value database

DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX
• Fully Managed in-memory cache for
DynamoDB
• 10x performance improvement – single- digit millisecond latency to microseconds
latency – when accessing your DynamoDB
tables
• Secure, highly scalable & highly available
• Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP
level: DAX is only used for and is
integrated with DynamoDB, while
ElastiCache can be used for other
databases

102 Redshift overview
Redshift Overview
• Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but it’s not used for OLTP
• It’s OLAP – online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
• Load data once every hour, not every second
• 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
• Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
• Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP), highly available
• Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
• Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
• BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it

part 103
Amazon EMR
• EMR stands for “Elastic MapReduce”
• EMR helps creating (Hadoop clusters) (Big Data) to analyze and process
vast amount of data
• The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
• Also supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink…
