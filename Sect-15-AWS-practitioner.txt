VPC – Crash Course
• VPC is something you should know in depth for the AWS Certified Solutions
Architect Associate & AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
	• At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
	• VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
	• Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
	• VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
	• Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
	• Transit Gateway

part 171

VPC & Subnets Primer 
• VPC -Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources
(regional resource)
• Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC
(Availability Zone resource)
• A public subnet is a subnet that is
accessible from the internet
• A private subnet is a subnet that is not
accessible from the internet
• To define access to the internet and
between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
• Internet Gateways helps our VPC
instances connect with the internet
• Public Subnets have a route to the
internet gateway.
• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) &
NAT Instances (self-managed) allow
your instances in your Private Subnets
to access the internet while remaining
private

Network ACL & Security Groups
	• NACL (Network ACL)
	• A firewall which controls traffic from and tosubnet
	• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	• Are attached at the Subnet level
	• Rules only include IP addresses
• Security Groups
	• A firewall that controls traffic to and from anENI / an EC2 Instance
	• Can have only ALLOW rules
	• Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

part 173

Network ACL & Security Groups
• NACL (Network ACL)
• A firewall which controls traffic from and to
subnet
• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
• Are attached at the Subnet level
• Rules only include IP addresses
• Security Groups
• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an
ENI / an EC2 Instance
• Can have only ALLOW rules
• Rules include IP addresses and other security
groups

Network ACL & Security Groups
• NACL (Network ACL)
	• A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
	• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	• Are attached at the Subnet level
	• Rules only include IP addresses
• Security Groups
	• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
	• Can have only ALLOW rules
	• Rules include IP addresses and other securitygroups

VPC Flow Logs
• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	• VPC Flow Logs
	• Subnet Flow Logs
	• Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
	• Subnets to internet
	• Subnets to subnets
	• Internet to subnets
• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic
Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc…
• VPC Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs

VPC Peering 
• Connect two VPC, privately using
AWS’ network
• Make them behave as if they were
in the same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP
address range)
• VPC Peering connection is not
transitive (must be established for
each VPC that need to
communicate with one another)

part 174

VPC Endpoints
• Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS
Services using a private network instead
of the public www network
• This gives you enhanced security and
lower latency to access AWS services
• VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
• VPC Endpoint Interface: the res

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
• Site to Site VPN

	• Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
	• The connection is automatically encrypted
	• Goes over the public internet
• Direct Connect (DX)
	• Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	• The connection is private, secure and fast
	• Goes over a private network
	• Takes at least a month to establish

Site-to-Site VPN
• On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
• AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)

part 176

Transit Gateway 
• For having transitive peering
between thousands of VPC and
on
-premises, hub-and-spoke (star)
connection
• One single Gateway to provide
this functionality
• Works with Direct Connect
Gateway, VPN connections

part 177

• VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
• Subnets:Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
• Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
• NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
• NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
• Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
• VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive
• VPC Endpoints: Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
• VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
• Site to Site VPN: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
• Direct Connect: direct private connection to AWS
• Transit Gateway: Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
