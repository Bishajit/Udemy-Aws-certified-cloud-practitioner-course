What’s an EBS Volume?
• An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach
to your instances while they run
• It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
• They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
• They are bound to a specific availability zone
• Analogy: Think of them as a “network USB stick”
• Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or
Magnetic per month

EBS Volume
• It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
• It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of
latency
• It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
• It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
• An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
• To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
• Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
• You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
• You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

EBS – Delete on Termination attribute
• Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
• By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
• By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
• This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
• Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

Part 54

EBS Snapshots
• Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
• Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
• Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

 Part 55 Ami overview  

AMI Overview
• AMI = Amazon Machine Image
• AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
• You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
• Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
• AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
• You can launch EC2 instances from:
• A Public AMI: AWS provided
• Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
• An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
