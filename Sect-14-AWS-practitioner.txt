Sect 14 Cloud monitoring
 
part 157

Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
• CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
• Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn…)
• Metrics have timestamps
• Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metric

Important Metrics
• EC2 instances: CPU Utilization, Status Checks, Network (not RAM)
	• Default metrics every 5 minutes
	• Option for Detailed Monitoring ($$$): metrics every 1 minute
• EBS volumes: Disk Read/Writes
• S3 buckets: BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests
• Billing:Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
• Service Limits: how much you’ve been using a service API
• Custom metrics: push your own metrics

Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
• Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
• Alarms actions…
• EC2 Actions: stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance

Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
• Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
• Alarms actions…
	• Auto Scaling: increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count	
	• EC2 Actions: stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance
	• SNS notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic
	• Various options (sampling, %, max, min, etc…)
	• Can choose the period on which to evaluate an alarm
	• Example: create a billing alarm on the CloudWatch Billing metric
	• Alarm States: OK. INSUFFICIENT_DATA, ALARM


part 159
Amazon CloudWatch Logs 
• CloudWatch Logs can collect log from:
	• Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application
	• ECS: collection from containers
	• AWS Lambda: collection from function logs
	• CloudTrail based on filter
	• CloudWatch log agents: on EC2 machines or on-premises servers
	• Route53: Log DNS queries
• Enables real-time monitoring of logs
• Adjustable CloudWatch Logs retention

CloudWatch Logs for EC2
• By default, no logs from your EC2
instance will go to CloudWatch
• You need to run a CloudWatch
agent on EC2 to push the log files
you want
• Make sure IAM permissions are
correct
• The CloudWatch log agent can be
setup on-premises too

part 161
Amazon CloudWatch Events
• Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts) 
• Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something 
• Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages…

Amazon EventBridge
• EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events
• Default event bus: generated by AWS services (CloudWatch Events)
• Partner event bus: receive events from SaaS service or applications
(Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0…)
• Partner event bus: receive events from SaaS service or applications
(Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0…)
• Custom Event buses: for your own applications
• Schema Registry: model event schema
• EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities
• The CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge

part 163
AWS CloudTrail
• Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
• CloudTrail is enabled by default!
• Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account by:
	• Console
	• SDK
	• CLI
	• AWS Services
• Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
• A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
• If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!


CloudTrail Events
• Management Events:
	• Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
	• Examples: 
		• Configuring security (IAM AttachRolePolicy)
		• Configuring rules for routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet)
		• Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail)
	• By default, trails are configured to log management events.
	• Can separate Read Events (that don’t modify resources) from Write Events (that may modify resources)
• Data Events:
	• By default, data events are not logged (because high volume operations)
	• Amazon S3 object-level activity (ex: GetObject, DeleteObject, PutObject): can separate Read and Write Events
	• AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)
CloudTrail Insights
• Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
	• inaccurate resource provisioning
	• hitting service limits
	• Bursts of AWS IAM actions
	• Gaps in periodic maintenance activity
• CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events to create a baseline
	• Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
	• Event is sent to Amazon S3
	• An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)

CloudTrail Events Retention
	• Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail
	• To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 and use Athena


part 165
• Debugging in Production, the good old way:
	• Test locally
	• Add log statements everywhere
	• Re-deploy in production
• Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard.
• Debugging: one big monolith “easy”, distributed services “hard”
• No common views of your entire architecture

AWS X-Ray advantages
• Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
 	• Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture 
• Pinpoint service issues 
• Review request behavior 
• Find errors and exceptions
 • Are we meeting time SLA? 
• Where I am throttled? 
• Identify users that are impacted

part 166
Amazon CodeGuru
• An ML-powered service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations 
• Provides two functionalities
	• CodeGuru Reviewer: automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
	• CodeGuru Profiler: visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)

Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
• Identify critical issues, security
vulnerabilities, and hard-to-find bugs
• Example: common coding best practices,
resource leaks, security detection, input
validation
• Uses Machine Learning and automated
reasoning
• Hard-learned lessons across millions of
code reviews on 1000s of open-source
and Amazon repositories
• Supports Java and Python
• Integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and
AWS CodeCommit

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler
• Helps understand the runtime behavior of your
application
• Example: identify if your application is consuming
excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
• Features:
	• Identify and remove code inefficiencies
	• Improve application performance (e.g., reduce CPU utilization)
	• Decrease compute costs
	• Provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
	• Anomaly Detection
• Minimal overhead on application

part 167
AWS Status - Service Health Dashboard
• Shows all regions, all services
health
• Shows historical information
for each day
• Has an RSS feed you can
subscribe to

part 168

AWS Personal Health Dashboard
• AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation
guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.
• While the Service Health Dashboard displays the general status of
AWS services, Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized
view into the performance and availability of the AWS services
underlying your AWS resources.
• The dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you
manage events in progress and provides proactive notification to
help you plan for scheduled activities. 

AWS Personal Health Dashboard
• Shows how AWS outages directly impact you &
your AWS resources
• Alert, remediation, proactive, scheduled activities

part 169
