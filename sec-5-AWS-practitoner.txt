Section 5 part 35 EC2 basics

Amazon EC2
• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
	• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & configuration options
-Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
-How much compute power & cores (CPU)
-How much random-access memory (RAM)
-How much storage space:
	-Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	-hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
-Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address

EC2 User Data
-• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
-bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
-• That script is only run once at the instance first start
-• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	• Installing updates
	• Installing software
	• Downloading common files from the internet
	• Anything you can think of
The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

Section 5 part 36 EC@ instance with EC2 User data to have a wevbsite hands
Hands-On:

Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
• We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
• We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
• We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
• We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

Sec 5 part 35 Ec2 baic types 
EC2 Instance Types - Overview
• AWS has the following naming convention:
• m: instance class
• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
• 2xlarge: size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
-Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance  processors:
• Batch processing workloads
• Media transcoding
• High performance web servers
• High performance computing (HPC)
• Scientific modeling & machine learning
• Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
access to large data sets on local storage
		• Use cases:
• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
• Relational & NoSQL databases
• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
• Data warehousing applications
• Distributed file systems

Section 5 part 39 security groups and Classsic ports

Introduction to Security Groups
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
• Security groups only contain allow rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive
• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
• They regulate:
	• Access to Ports
	• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
	• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Classic Ports to know

• 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
• 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
• 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
• 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
• 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
• 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance
