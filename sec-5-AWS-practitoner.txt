Section 5 part 35 EC2 basics

Amazon EC2
• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
	• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & configuration options
-Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
-How much compute power & cores (CPU)
-How much random-access memory (RAM)
-How much storage space:
	-Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	-hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
-Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address

EC2 User Data
-• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
-bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
-• That script is only run once at the instance first start
-• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	• Installing updates
	• Installing software
	• Downloading common files from the internet
	• Anything you can think of
The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

Section 5 part 36 EC@ instance with EC2 User data to have a wevbsite hands
Hands-On:

Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
• We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
• We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
• We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
• We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

Sec 5 part 35 Ec2 baic types 
EC2 Instance Types - Overview
• AWS has the following naming convention:
• m: instance class
• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
• 2xlarge: size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
-Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance  processors:
• Batch processing workloads
• Media transcoding
• High performance web servers
• High performance computing (HPC)
• Scientific modeling & machine learning
• Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
access to large data sets on local storage
		• Use cases:
• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
• Relational & NoSQL databases
• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
• Data warehousing applications
• Distributed file systems

Section 5 part 39 security groups and Classsic ports

Introduction to Security Groups
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
• Security groups only contain allow rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive
• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
• They regulate:
	• Access to Ports
	• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
	• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Security Groups
Good to know
	• Can be attached to multiple instances
	• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
	• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
	• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
	• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
	• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
	error or it’s not launched
	• All inbound traffic is blocked by default
	• All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Classic Ports to know

• 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
• 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
• 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
• 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
• 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
• 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

• Windows: • Putty Lecture • If Windows 10: SSH on Windows 10 lecture

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
• On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing
• Reserved: (MINIMUM 1 year)
• Reserved Instances: long workloads
• Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
• Scheduled Reserved Instances: example – every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm
• Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
• Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
• Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware

EC2 On Demand
• Pay for what you use:
• Linux - billing per second, after the first minute
• All other operating systems (ex: Windows) - billing per hour
• Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
• No long-term commitment
• Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where
you can't predict how the application will behave

EC2 Reserved Instances
• Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
• Reservation period: 1 year = + discount | 3 years = +++ discount
• Purchasing options: no upfront | partial upfront = + | All upfront = ++ discount
• Reserve a specific instance type
• Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
• Convertible Reserved Instance
• can change the EC2 instance type
• Up to 45% discount
• Scheduled Reserved Instances
• launch within time window you reserve
• When you require a fraction of day / week / month
• Commitment for 1 year only

EC2 Spot Instances
• Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
• Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the
current spot price
• The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
• Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
• Batch jobs
• Data analysis
• Image processing
• Any distributed workloads
• Workloads with a flexible start and end time
• Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

EC2 Dedicated Hosts
• An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance
capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you
address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
• Allocated for your account for a 3-year period reservation
• More expensive
• Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
• Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

EC2 Dedicated Instances 
• Instances running on
hardware that’s dedicated to
you
• May share hardware with
other instances in same
account
• No control over instance
placement (can move
hardware after Stop / Start)

AWS
•Infrastructure (global network security)
• Isolation on physical hosts
• Replacing faulty hardware
• Compliance validation
'
You the customer
•Security Groups rules
• Operating-system patches and updates
• Software and utilities installed
on the EC2 instance
• IAM Roles assigned to EC2 &
IAM user access management
• Data security on your instance
